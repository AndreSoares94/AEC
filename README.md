# Aprendizagem e Extração de Conhecimento
University project for Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction in Python - subject of Software Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
This project involves the study and implementation of predictive machine learning models, to be specific the  prediction of the annual salary of a person by analysing a dataset with multiple caracteristics of the employees of multiple companys.

Made in a Python enviroment with help of the Sklearn library. At first an analysis and treatment of the data was made so a better visualization of the distribution of the dataset was achieved in order to relate it to the variable to predict (salary-classification). Then we had to develop the predictive models, validate and optimizing the performance and compare them.

Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Random Forests were the models studied.
